This package contains the default implementation of the decision tree algorithm.

The decision tree algorithm supports:
+ Binary classification
+ Regression
+ Information loss calculation with entropy and gini for classification and variance for regression
+ Both continuous and categorical features

# Tree improvements
+ Node model pruning
+ Printing to dot files

# Future Ensemble Extensions

+ Random forests
+ Boosting
+ Extremely randomized trees
